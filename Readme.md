# IT project management
## YAMR - Yet another movie recommender

In a group of 2 students, we have learned the basics of project management by planning and executing a small IT project. The focus was not on the project execution, but rather on the process and techniques of managing an IT project.

My learnings:
* basic project management skills
* got to know new technologies and concepts (Graphlab & Recommendation engines)
* improved knowledge of technologies and concepts (Python, AngluarJS, REST)

We have used Apiary API blueprint to document our API: [docs.yamr.apiary.io](http://docs.yamr.apiary.io)
